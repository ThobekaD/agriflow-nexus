# Ag Supply Chain Optimizer

AgriFlow Nexus is a multi-agent AI system built with the Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Google Cloud, designed to optimize the agricultural supply chain for crops and beef in Southern Africa. By integrating real-time data on weather, market prices, and regional conflict, AgriFlow Nexus provides actionable intelligence to farmers and logistics companies, aiming to reduce post-harvest losses, enhance profitability, and ensure supply chain resilience.

The Problem

Southern Africa's agricultural sector faces significant challenges, including unpredictable weather patterns, volatile market prices, and logistical hurdles often exacerbated by regional instability. These factors contribute to substantial post-harvest losses and limit access to lucrative international markets that demand stringent traceability.

Our Solution: A Constellation of AI Agents

AgriFlow Nexus employs a swarm of specialized AI agents, each performing a critical function in the supply chain:

FieldSentinel: Monitors crop and pasture health using simulated satellite data.
WeatherOracle: Provides hyper-local weather forecasts to optimize harvesting and transport schedules.
PricePredictor: Leverages BigQuery ML to forecast commodity prices, empowering farmers to sell at the optimal time.
ConflictGuard: A unique agent that analyzes real-time conflict data (from ACLED) to identify and mitigate security risks along transportation routes.
LogisticsMaster: An advanced route optimizer that considers cost, time, and now, safety, to choreograph the movement of goods.
Technical Implementation

Core Framework: Agent Development Kit (ADK) for Python.
Cloud Platform: Google Cloud Platform.
Data & Analytics: BigQuery for data warehousing and BigQuery ML for time-series forecasting.
Compute: Cloud Run for scalable, serverless deployment of agents.
Routing: Google Maps Routes API (simulated with ortools).
Innovation and Impact

AgriFlow Nexus is innovative in its holistic approach, particularly with the integration of the ConflictGuard agent. This addresses a critical, often-overlooked aspect of supply chain management in many parts of the world. By making the supply chain smarter and safer, AgriFlow Nexus can:

Reduce Spoilage: Optimized logistics and timely harvesting can significantly cut down on post-harvest losses.
Increase Farmer Profits: Better market timing and lower transportation costs lead to higher incomes.
Enhance Food Security: A more efficient supply chain means more food reaches consumers.
Unlock New Markets: The foundation for EU-grade traceability is laid, opening up export opportunities.
